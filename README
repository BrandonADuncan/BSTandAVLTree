# Project 2

Project 2 is focused on performance using our driving main method MainTimer.java
The first iteration uses a Binary Search Tree Map and Set in conjunction with our 
DEA class. The objective of the project was to read in an old data set of Opiod
purchases for a region (.tsv file), put them into a map using the Buyer's name
and additional info as the key, with a List of purchases as the value. Then the
method flagSuspiciousBuyers reads a new data set and compares it to our old data map.
If any of the new purchases include either a new buyer, or a purchase greater than 
the mean + 4* the Standard Deviation it would be flagged as suspicious and added 
to a set to be returned and printed. If flagged for an unusually large purchase, the 
transaction ID will also be included. The main objective of this project is to
perfom these actions in the most efficient manner using a preferred data structure.
the data sets should be in .tsv format.

## Usage

```java 
usage: MainTimer historicFilename newFilename

DEA.readHistoricData(filename) # creates a map using chosen data structure of 
                                 purchases recorded in the .tsv file. 
DEA.flagSuspiciousBuyers(filename) # returns a list of suspicious buyers after 
                                    reading in new data and checking for flag conditions.
```
